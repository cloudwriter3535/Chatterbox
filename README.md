# Chatterbox

## Rule-Based Chatbot UI

Welcome! This repository is dedicated to developing a User Interface (UI) for a simple Rule-Based Chatbot. This is a primaryâ€”educational learning journey into the creation and workings of interfaces.

## Project Aim 

The goal is to develop a web-accessible interface for users to interact with the simple rule-based chatbot. This will act as the foundation or shell for potential future developments.

## Future Prospects

Currently, the project is in its earlier stages, as the main focus is the fundamental aspects of the chatbot UI. As learning and experience continue, I plan to evolve this bare shell into a fully operational rule-based chatbot. The goal is to design it with extensibility, allowing for future modifications which would adapt to specific needs or imaginative uses.

Copying, reusing code, and suggestions/contributions are welcomed and encouraged.
